# **Cipher Project**
### This project is a C++ application designed to encrypt and decrypt messages using various classical cipher techniques. The program supports multiple ciphers such as 
### the Atbash cipher, Morse code and XOR cipher. Users can input text and choose their preferred cipher method for 
### encoding or decoding the message.

## **Features**
### Encode and decode messages using classical cipher techniques:
 - #### Affine Cipher
 - #### Route Cipher
 - #### Atbash Cipher
 - #### Vignere Cipher
 - #### Baconian Cipher
 - #### Simple Substitution Cipher
 - #### Polybuis Cipher
 - #### Morse Code
 - #### XOR Cipher
 - #### Rail-fence Cipher
### Error handling and user-friendly interface
### Detailed comments for code clarity

## **Usage**
### After compiling and running the program, users will be prompted to specify whether to encode or decode the message, input their message and choose a cipher method.
### Example:
#### 1. Choose "Encryption" to encode a message.
#### 2. Input your message (ex. "HELLO").
#### 3. Choose "Morse Cipher" 
#### 4. The encoded Morse code will be displayed.

## **Contributions**
### This project was a collaborative effort with contributions from multiple team members. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the work:

### George Youssef:
- #### Implemented the Baconian cipher, Simple Substitution cipher, and Morse code functionalities.
- #### Organized the code output structure and added detailed comments for clarity.

### Mina Maher: 
- #### Implemented the XOR cipher, Polybuis cipher, and Rail-fence cipher functionalities.
- #### Created the the encryption menu, decryption menu and main menu.

### Mohamed Adel: 
- #### Implemented the Affine cipher, Route cipher, Atbash Cipher and Vignere cipher functionalities.
- #### Performed code reviews and ensured error handling was in place.
